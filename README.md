![DoSarray](doc/dosarray_logo.png)

DoSarray is a system that facilitates carrying out experiments involving
[Denial-of-Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) (DoS) attacks and mitigations.
It is developed at the University of Pennsylvania as part of the [DeDOS project](http://dedos-project.net/).

## Getting started...
For a quick peek take a look at an
[example experiment](experiments/dosarray_slowloris_experiment.sh).
When run, this script generates the following output:
```
$ export DOSARRAY_SCRIPT_DIR=`pwd`
$ ./experiments/dosarray_slowloris_experiment.sh
Started HTTP experiment at Wed Jun  6 23:06:27 EDT 2018: apache_worker, slowloris, Default config
  Writing to /Users/nik/dosarray/example_experiment/
DoSarray stdout was collected in: /tmp/dosarray.stdout.yb39PO
DoSarray stderr was collected in: /tmp/dosarray.stderr.2QAwjY
Finished at Wed Jun  6 23:08:57 EDT 2018
```
The various logs and graphs generated by DoSarray could then be found in the
`example_experiment/` directory.


## Documentation
Please see our [usage guide](doc/USAGE.md), which explains how to set the two
levels of configuration: [DoSarray-wide](config/dosarray_config.sh) and
experiment-specific (such as in the
[example](experiments/dosarray_slowloris_experiment.sh) above).
