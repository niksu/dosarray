## DoSarray documentation

* See the [main README](../README.md) for a general overview of the system.
* DoSarray's [usage](USAGE.md) information describes how to [set up DoSarray](SETUP.md) and [preparing the experiment target](TARGET.md).
* [FAQ](FAQ.md)
* Since DoSarray involves multiple interacting components, diagnosing failures can be challenging. We prepared a [checklist](CHECKLIST.md) to simplify this process.
* We have a guide on [3D-printing DoSarray's 3D graphs](3D_printing.md).

## Release information

* The main changes introduced in each DoSarray release is listed in our [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md).
